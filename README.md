1. You are designing a Java software application that can calculate the area of different kinds of geometric shapes. In the first version, you are told to support circle, square and rectangle but your design should be flexible to support other types of shapes in the future (and other types of calculations for the shapes). The area of a geometric shape depends on what kind of shape it is (for circle, area depends on the radius; for square and rectangle area depends on the length of the sides). Consumers of your classes need to be able to create circles, squares and rectangles of various sizes and be able to calculate the area of each.

a. Describe the class-level design for your solution. Your design should include
    i. any interfaces, abstract classes and concrete classes
    ii. instance variables in each class
    iii. definitions of constructors for each concrete class
    iv. definitions  of the method(s) for calculating the area of each kind of shape

b. Write Java code that will create a collection that will store all the objects created in question #1a and then sort that collection based on the area of each object.
